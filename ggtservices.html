          <p>
            Medical radiography is a broad term that refers to a variety of
            studies that require the use of x-ray techniques to visualize
            internal organs.

          <h2>Medical Laboratory Services</h2>
          <p>
            Laboratory medicine is an essential component of public health. It
            is critical for disease detection in individuals and populations.
            Laboratory tests are also useful for detecting environmental toxins
            like lead.

          <h2>Molecular Science Genetic Studies</h2>
          <p>
            Molecular genetics (MG) is a scientific discipline concerned with
            the structure and function of genes at the molecular level. It also
            includes genetic engineering, which is defined as the direct
            manipulation of an organism’s genome.

          <h2>01. Medical Microbiology & Parasitology</h2>
          <p>
            Our Clinical microbiology tests isolate and characterize infectious
            organisms (e.g. bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites) so that the
            diseases they cause can be managed and treated in patients.
          </p>
          <h2>02.Clinical Biochemistry</h2>
          <p>
            Clinical chemistry tests are used to determine the concentrations of
            chemical components in bodily fluids and tissues. The results of
            these tests are then used to evaluate the functions of body organs.
            Chemical components such as blood glucose, proteins, electrolytes,
            lipids, and other metabolic substances are detected and measured
            using clinical chemistry tests.

          <img src="./radiology section.jpg" alt="radiology section" />
          <h2>01. Digital X-Ray</h2>
          <p>
            Digital radiography (DR) is an advanced form of x-ray inspection
            that generates a digital radiographic image on a computer instantly
          </p>
          <h2>02. Ultrasonography</h2>
          <p>
            Diagnostic ultrasound, also known as sonography or diagnostic
            medical sonography, is a type of imaging that uses sound waves to
            create images of structures within your body. The images can provide
            useful information for diagnosing and treating a wide range of
            diseases and conditions.
          </p>
          <h2>03. Digital Mammography</h2>
          <p>
            Digital mammography, also known as full-field digital mammography
            (FFDM), is a type of mammography that replaces X-ray film with
            solid-state detectors that convert X-rays into electrical signals.
            These detectors resemble those used in digital cameras.
          </p>
          <h2>04. Cardiotocography</h2>
          <p>
            Cardiotocography (CTG) is a method of continuously recording the
            fetal heart rate using an ultrasound transducer placed on the
            mother’s abdomen. CTG is widely used in pregnancy to assess fetal
            wellbeing, particularly in pregnancies with a high risk of
            complications.

        </div>
        <div class="radiology-right">
          <h2>05. Echocardiography</h2>
          <p>
            An echocardiogram is an ultrasound examination of your heart’s
            structure and function. An echo can detect a variety of conditions
            such as cardiomyopathy and valve disease. Transthoracic and
            transesophageal echo tests are two types of echo tests.
          </p>
          <h2>06. 12 Channel Electrocardiography</h2>
          <p>
            The electrical activity of the heart is graphically represented by
            an electrocardiograph (or ECG system). Electrodes placed on the
            skin’s surface collect this activity. Electrocardiography analysis
            can detect heart problems such as recent or ongoing heart attacks,
            arrhythmia, coronary artery blockage, damaged heart muscle, dilated
            heart volume, and so on.
          </p>

          <h2>07. Electroencephalography</h2>
          <p>
            An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that uses small metal discs
            (electrodes) attached to the scalp to measure electrical activity in
            the brain. Brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and are
            constantly active, even while sleeping.
          </p>

          <h2>08. Computed Tomography</h2>
          <p>
            CT scanning is another name for computed tomography. A CT scan is a
            diagnostic imaging procedure that produces images of the inside of
            the body using X-rays and computer technology. It displays detailed
            images of any part of the body, such as bones, muscles, fat, organs,
            and blood vessels.
          </p>
          <h2>09. Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h2>
          <p>
            Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique that
            creates detailed images of your body’s organs and tissues by using a
            magnetic field and computer-generated radio waves.

          <h2>01. DNA Sequencing and Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            Sequencing DNA entails determining the order of the four chemical
            building blocks that comprise the DNA molecule, known as “bases.”
            The sequence informs scientists about the type of genetic
            information carried by a specific DNA segment.
          </p>
          <h2>02. Microarray and Genotyping</h2>
          <p>
            Microarrays are an excellent platform for evaluating known markers
            in the human genome, allowing researchers to identify single
            nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or larger structural changes among
            millions of markers
          </p>
          <h2>03. Cytogenetics</h2>
          <p>
            Cytogenetics is important in detecting chromosomal abnormalities
            associated with cancer, as well as identifying new alterations that
            allow for more research and knowledge about the genetic aspects of
            these diseases.

            BSL-3 laboratories are used to research infectious agents or toxins
            that can spread through the air and cause potentially fatal
            infections. All experiments are carried out in a biosafety cabinet.
            BSL-3 laboratories are intended to be simple to decontaminate.
          </p>
          <h2>06. Paternity Testing</h2>
          <p>
            A DNA paternity test determines whether a man is the child’s
            biological father by extracting DNA from a cheek swab.
          </p>
          <h2>07. Genetic Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            The examination of a DNA sample for mutations (changes) that may

          <h2>08. Covid-19 test</h2>
          <p>
            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a viral infection caused by a
            recently discovered coronavirus. Following a covid outbreak, it is
            ideal to take the test for prompt case identification, prudent
            treatment of positive cases, and immediate isolation to prevent
            spread. Early testing also aids in identifying anyone who has come
            into contact with infected people, allowing them to be treated as
            soon as possible. We provide accurate, timely, and dependable
            testing services to facilitate proper management of positive cases
            and to assist negative clients in traveling safely.
